So what are Airport adapters and why are they the preferred piece of hardware? Well they're genuine Apple Wireless cards pulled from MacBooks and iMacs meaning no extra configurations/kexts are required to get tis hardware up and running.Main issue is that they require an adapoter to PC hardware and are genrally bulkier making them unfavoable in laptops but perfect for desktops.
