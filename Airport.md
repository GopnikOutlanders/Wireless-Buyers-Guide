So what are Airport adapters and why are they the preferred piece of hardware? Well, they're genuine Apple Wireless cards pulled from MacBooks and iMacs meaning no extra configurations/kexts are required to get this hardware up and running. The main issue is that they require an adapter to PC hardware and are generally bulkier making them unfavourable in laptops but perfect for desktops.

Best part, **no kexts needed!**
