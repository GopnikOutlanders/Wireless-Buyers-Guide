# Where's my Intel Wifi

So it's an interesting time, we're finally getting traction on an Intel Wifi kext for macOS. While not finished and much to be done, we have the itlwm project on the horizon:

* [itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm)
  * Currently does connect and even support Apple's own IO80211 framework(via AirportItlwm)
  * Unfortunately doesn't support Airdrop, see here for features and limitations: [OpenIntelWireless](https://openintelwireless.github.io/)
