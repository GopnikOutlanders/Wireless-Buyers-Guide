You immediately bolt to the Settings pane and see no wifi option and wonder where you may have gone wrong in your install. Scowering the inter-webs did provide an answer but it was not that which you wanted to hear, \"your wifi card is shit ANON!\" said some user on a forum with far too many ads and a broken layout. They then proceeded to tell you how stupid you were to even think your wireless card would work, \"how dare you not have the knowledge of Hackintosh hive mind\".

Well, they're genuine Apple Wireless cards pulled from MacBooks and iMacs meaning no extra configurations/kexts are required to get this hardware up and running. The main issue is that they require an adapter to PC hardware and are generally bulkier making them unfavourable in laptops but perfect for desktops. Best part, no kexts needed! Note: When buying a Wifi card and an adapter, make sure the antenna sockets match up, there are 2 main types of sockets: MHF4: Commonly used on M.2 and Apple's laptop wifi cards U.FL: Commonly used on mPCIe and Apple's desktop wifi cards Which cards shipped with what Socketed cards: Ones you can buy and install yourself BCM943602CDP(Wifi) + 20703A1(Bluetooth 4.0) + U.FL Connector iMac16,x iMac17,1 iMac18,x(Different Bluetooth module, 20703A2, Bluetooth 4.2) BCM94360CD(Wifi) + 20702B0(Bluetooth 4.0) + U.FL Connector iMac14,x iMac15,x MacPro6,1 BCM94331CD(Wifi) + BRCM20702(05AC:828b, Bluetooth 4.0) + U.FL Connector iMac13,x BCM94360CS2(Wifi) + BRCM20702(05AC:821f, Bluetooth 4.0) + MHF4 Connector MacBookAir5,x MacBookAir6,x MacBookAir7,x BCM943602CS(Wifi) + 20703A1(Bluetooth 4.0) + MHF4 Connector MacBookPro12,x BCM94360CS(Wifi) + 20702B0(Bluetooth 4.0) + MHF4 Connector MacMini7,x MacBookPro11,x BCM94360CSAX + BRCM20702(05AC:828c, Bluetooth 4.0) + MHF4 Connector MacBookPro10,x BCM94350 + MHF4 Connector MacBook8,1 - 4350C1, Bluetooth 4.0 MacBookPro13,x - 20703A2, Bluetooth 4.2 MacBookPro14,x - 4350, Bluetooth 4.2 Solder/proprietary cards: Apple's custom cards that no one else has, specifically called SOCs from Broadcom BCM4364(Wifi) + 4364B0(Bluetooth 5.0) iMac19,x MacMini8,1 MacBookPro15,x iMacPro1,1 - 4364(Bluetooth 4.2) MacPro7,1- 4364B3(Bluetooth 5.0) BCM4355 MacBookAir8,1 What does an Airport adapter look like "},"types-of-wireless-card/pcie.html":{"url":"types-of-wireless-card/pcie.html","title":"PCIe","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun May 03 2020 16:56:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) By far the most popular option for desktop users has been to buy an old Apple Aiport Wireless card and place it into a PCIe riser card.

Do your research on your hardware to see if there's a whitelist. The whitelist is as follows: Lenovo(7th gen and older) 6th and 7th gen systems should have a BIOS update that remove the whitelist The other thing to keep in mind is that M.2 wireless cards come in 2 variant: A Key E Key Do your research to see what slot your hardware has(and don't mix up E key with mini PCIe).

Supported Bluetooth chipset Well I was orginally going to manually find every supported model but user MarkVillacampa has done a great job already so I'll link to his findings Bluetooth List Asus and Lenovo note: On 7th gen and newer chipsets, Bluetooth has been intergrated into the PCH and these OEMS don't have any USB rails wired off of their A/E slots. This means that you'll need to either solder new headers for Bluetooth on your motherboard or route a USB cable to an existing port So why does Bluetooth work on my Intel card Well, it's a bit complicated and involves looking at IOkit and how it handles different devices. Bluetooth is actually quite simple in how it interacts with the system and thanks to being generally run off the USB rail, generic devices can easily hook into IOKit and act semi natively(usually with the loss of Handoff, Airdrop, etc). Wifi, on the other hand, is quite a bit more complicated as there needs to be explicit support in the IO80211 family for the device so only Broadcom/Atheros cards have any chance of working So if you rebooted from Windows into macOS, the firmware on the card may have stuck on allowing you temporary Bluetooth support on your'stve card. To make sure this sticks around, you can use a firmware injecting kext like that found on the IntelBluetoothFirmware repo Bluetooth in the BIOS So to support Bluetooth in the BIOS, you'll need a Bluetooth device that supports HID Proxy. The idea of HID proxy is to create a minimal Bluetooth stack that is then used into tricking the BIOS into thinking your Bluetooth keyboard is actually a USB one, as there aren't any firmwares that actually implement Bluetooth. All of Apple's cards natively support this feature but you'll need to search on a case-by-case basis with other devices Retaining Bluetooth keys between OSes This is mainly for devices that only have 1 Bluetooth profile which can be a bit frustrating when switching between OSes, we'll our local Frewt boll has saved us again!
