# Express cards

So this is also a real bad idea but I accidentaly found Express Card based wireless cards searching for other cards:

Up to High Sierra:
* AR9280
   * Ubiquiti Networks SR71-X
   
   
With this model you'll need to reinject the old plugin the AR9280 used in High Sierra to work in Mojave. There's a couple different kexts to do this but generally we recommend avoiding this card unless absolutly necassary
