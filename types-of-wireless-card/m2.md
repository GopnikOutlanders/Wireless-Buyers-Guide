# WORK IN PROGRESS


M.2 based wireless cards get into a fun little realm of manufacturer lock-in, specifically that your manufacturer may have a whitelist that only supports their brand of wireless cards(Lenovo is the biggest culprit of this). Do your research on your hardware to see if there's a whitelist.

The other thing to keep in mind is that M.2 wireless cards come in 2 variant:
* A Key
* E Key
Do your research to see what slot your hardware has(and don't mix up E key with mini PCIe).
